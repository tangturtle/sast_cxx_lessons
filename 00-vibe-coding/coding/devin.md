# Devin: Comprehensive Documentation (2025)

## Overview

Devin is the world's first fully autonomous AI software engineer, developed by Cognition AI. Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that provide suggestions and completions, Devin operates as an independent agent capable of handling entire software engineering tasks end-to-end. Devin can write code, run tests, debug issues, deploy applications, and manage pull requests with minimal human intervention. The platform represents a paradigm shift from AI-assisted coding to AI-driven autonomous development.
