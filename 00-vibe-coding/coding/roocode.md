# Roo Code: Comprehensive Guide (2025)

## Overview

Roo Code is a VS Code extension that brings an AI development team to your editor. It coordinates multiple model-powered agents to plan tasks, write code, run/debug, and iterate. Roo supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other providers, and can operate autonomously with human checkpoints.

## Key Features

- Multi-agent orchestration: planner, coder, tester, fixer agents
- Autonomous workflows with approval steps
- Shell commands, file edits, and test execution
- Model flexibility (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.)
- Task history and reproducibility
- Custom prompts and tool configuration per workspace

## Strengths

- Strong at decomposing larger tasks into sub-agents
- Good defaults for full-stack web tasks
- BYO key; model-agnostic approach
- Active docs and community examples

## Limitations

- Autonomy quality varies by model and repo size
- Long tasks can be slow/expensive
- Primarily targets VS Code (JetBrains support evolving)

## Use Cases

- Build a CRUD feature end-to-end
- Migrate libraries/framework versions
- Write tests and fix failures in CI
- Debug runtime errors from logs

## Pricing/Access

- Extension is free
- BYO API keys (provider billing applies)
- Some hosted/managed options may be offered—see website

## Integration

- VS Code extension UI
- Command execution and terminal integration
- Git-aware diffs and PR-friendly output

## Getting Started

1. Install Roo Code from VS Code Marketplace
2. Configure one or more model providers in settings
3. Open a project and describe your task
4. Approve the plan and let the agents iterate

## Comparison Points

- vs Cline: Roo emphasizes multi-agent teamwork; Cline focuses on a single transparent, checkpointed agent
- vs Cursor/Windsurf: Roo augments existing VS Code rather than replacing it
