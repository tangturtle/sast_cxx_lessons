# Windsurf: Comprehensive Documentation (2025)

## Overview

Windsurf is an AI-native IDE developed by Cognition (the creators of Devin) that represents a significant evolution in AI-powered development environments. Built as a complete IDE rather than an extension, Windsurf combines the familiarity of VS Code with advanced agentic capabilities, real-time preview functionality, and sophisticated context management. The platform is specifically designed to keep developers in "flow state" by minimizing context-switching and providing seamless AI integration.

### Market Position

Windsurf has emerged as a strong competitor to Cursor, with particular strengths in:

- **Agentic automation** through its "Cascade" AI agent
- **Real-time preview and deployment** capabilities
- **Superior UX** for managing complex multi-step tasks
- **Enterprise adoption** with 4,000+ enterprise customers
- **Gartner recognition** as a Leader in the 2025 Magic Quadrant for AI Code Assistants
