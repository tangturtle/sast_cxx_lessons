# OpenAI ChatGPT and Codex: Code Generation Features (2025)

## Overview

OpenAI provides code generation capabilities through ChatGPT, the general-purpose AI assistant, and Codex, a specialized cloud-based software engineering agent. Codex represents OpenAI's dedicated coding solution with autonomous agent capabilities.

## Codex: Specialized Coding Agent (2025)

Codex is a new cloud-based software engineering agent powered by codex-1 model (optimized version of o3 for programming tasks). It enables developers to deploy multiple independent agents handling diverse coding tasks.

### Codex Capabilities

- Write new software features from descriptions
- Answer questions about codebases
- Fix bugs and resolve issues
- Propose pull requests
- Handle complex multi-step coding tasks
- Achieve 75% accuracy on coding tests

### Codex Availability

- **Global Rollout**: ChatGPT Pro, Enterprise, and Business users have access globally
- **Planned Expansion**: Plus and Edu user access coming soon
- **Pricing**: Initially offered at no additional cost, transitioning to rate-limited access with flexible pricing

### Codex Access Interface

- Sidebar in ChatGPT
- Users type prompts and click "Code" to assign coding tasks
- Users click "Ask" to ask questions about their codebase
- Task completion time: 1 to 30 minutes depending on complexity

### Programming Language Support

Codex creates code in over a dozen programming languages:
- Python (most effective)
- Go
- JavaScript
- Perl
- PHP
- Ruby
- Shell
- Swift
- TypeScript
- Additional languages supported

## ChatGPT General Code Generation

ChatGPT provides code assistance through conversational interface:
- Architecture and design guidance
- Code explanation and documentation
- Non-coding task assistance
- General programming problem-solving

### ChatGPT Availability

- Free tier with basic capabilities
- Plus subscription ($20/month) for advanced features
- Pro tier available for power users

### ChatGPT Models for Code

- ChatGPT uses various OpenAI models depending on subscription
- GPT-4o available for Pro and Plus subscribers
- Access to latest reasoning models

## ChatGPT IDE Integration

- Integration with Visual Studio Code
- GitHub Copilot ecosystem compatibility
- In-editor coding suggestions (indirect through Copilot)

## Model Implementation

- Codex-1: Specialized version of o3 optimized for programming
- o3: OpenAI's most capable reasoning model
- GPT-4o: Multimodal model with code capabilities

## Strengths

- Codex provides autonomous agent capabilities for complex tasks
- Excellent for architectural and design discussions
- General-purpose models excel at non-code problem-solving
- Strong reasoning capabilities
- Extensive programming language support
- Free tier available for ChatGPT

## Weaknesses and Limitations

- Codex is specialized tool requiring separate workflow from ChatGPT
- Less deep codebase understanding compared to IDE-integrated solutions
- Requires context to be provided through prompts (not automatic like IDE tools)
- Higher cognitive load for switching between tools
- ChatGPT lacks native IDE integration compared to Copilot or Cursor
- Codex tasks take 1-30 minutes - not real-time suggestions
- Pricing model in transition from "no additional cost" - final pricing unclear
